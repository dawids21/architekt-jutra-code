description: Produce or finalize a design artifact for a planning task in a spec-driven workflow (brainstorming → design → tasks). Use this skill whenever the user wants to design, architect, or technically plan a feature or refactor; whenever they point at a `.maister/tasks/development/YYYY-MM-DD-<task>/` folder and ask for a design; whenever they mention "design doc", "design phase", "spec out", "figure out how to build X", or want to resolve open questions from a brainstorming. Also use when the user wants to capture architectural decisions as ADRs alongside a design, or when they want to finalize an existing draft design after review.

# Design

Produce a **design** artifact: the second stage in a three-stage planning workflow (brainstorming → design → tasks). The design resolves open questions from the brainstorming into concrete technical decisions and specifies the technical shape of the change.

## Inputs and outputs

- **Input:** a path to a task folder under `.maister/tasks/development/YYYY-MM-DD-<task-name>/`. The user may give the folder alone (assume `brainstorming.md` inside it) or a specific file.
- **Output:**
  - `.maister/tasks/development/YYYY-MM-DD-<task-name>/design.md`
  - Zero or more new files in `.maister/docs/ADRs/`, plus an updated `.maister/docs/ADRs/INDEX.md`.

## Modes

This skill handles both phases of a design's life:

- **Draft** — first pass. Uses the **Assumptions to verify** section to flag every guess for human review. New ADRs are created with `Status: proposed`.
- **Finalize** — after review. Apply user feedback, clear the **Assumptions to verify** section, flip new ADRs from `proposed` to `accepted`, set design `Status: final`.

If a `design.md` already exists in the task folder, you are iterating — read it before doing anything else and use its current contents as the working state.

## Hard rules

1. **Brainstorming is authoritative.** Never re-derive requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints, edge cases, or anti-requirements. The brainstorming sits in the same folder; that proximity is the reference.
2. **Transform, don't duplicate.** Turn the brainstorming's "integration points" into a concrete list of changes per touchpoint, but do not restate them verbatim.
3. **Do not produce a "requirements" or "spec" mirror** of the brainstorming.
4. **Be technology-specific.** Commit to concrete frameworks, libraries, patterns. "We'll use a queue" is not a design — "We'll use a `BlockingQueue<UploadJob>` in `ImageUploadService` consumed by a single worker thread" is.
5. **No extensive implementation code in the design.** Show *shape*, not implementation. Acceptable: method signatures, type sketches (class + fields + key methods), schema snippets, endpoint definitions, sequence outlines. **Not** acceptable: full method bodies, multi-screen code blocks, anything line-by-line. Implementation belongs in the tasks/coding phase.
6. **Propose, then mark for revision.** Make the best technical decision you can. Where you guessed or extrapolated, log it in **Assumptions to verify** so the human can confirm or push back.
7. **ADRs are self-contained and persistent.** They outlive the task. Their Context section must describe the problem directly — do not link to brainstorming or design files (which are ephemeral, scoped to the task).

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Read inputs

- Locate the task folder. If the user gave a folder, the brainstorming is `brainstorming.md` inside it. If they gave a file, use that.
- Read the brainstorming fully. Pay particular attention to:
  - **Open questions** — you must resolve every one.
  - **Integration points** — you must transform each into concrete changes.
  - **Anti-requirements** — you must not violate them.
  - **Constraints & assumptions** — these bound your design.
- If `design.md` already exists in the same folder, read it. You're iterating — its current state is your starting point.

### Step 2 — Read the project documentation

**This step is non-negotiable.** A design written without reading the codebase's existing decisions tends to invent abstractions that don't fit and miss patterns the team already uses.

- **Project docs:** start at `.maister/docs/INDEX.md`. It describes what each documentation file covers. Read the files indexed there that are relevant to this task. Don't read everything — use the index to choose.
- **Prior decisions:** read `.maister/docs/ADRs/INDEX.md`. It summarizes every ADR. Open and read only the ADRs whose summaries are relevant to this task. You must respect prior ADRs or explicitly supersede them.
- **Touched files:** the specific files mentioned in the brainstorming's "Integration points" — open and skim them.
- **Missing documentation:** if a documentation file you'd expect (e.g., `.maister/docs/INDEX.md`, an architecture doc covering an area you're about to design into) doesn't exist, note this in the design file's **Assumptions to verify** section. Do not substitute by guessing from the source tree.

### Step 3 — Identify ADR-worthy decisions

Walk through the open questions from the brainstorming, plus any major decisions implied by the change. For each, classify:

- **Trivial / obvious** — resolve inline in the design doc's "Resolved questions" section.
- **Non-obvious** — has real tradeoffs, plausible alternatives a reasonable engineer might pick, or long-term implications. Write a separate ADR file.

Heuristic: *if you'd want to revisit why this was decided in 6 months, it's an ADR.*

### Step 4 — Draft (or revise) the design doc

- Path: `.maister/tasks/development/YYYY-MM-DD-<task-name>/design.md`.
- Use [design-template.md](design-template.md) as the structure. Sections that don't apply (e.g., no data model changes for a pure refactor) should remain with a brief note like `_No data model changes._` — the empty section signals you considered it.
- Apply the no-extensive-code rule from the hard rules.
- Fill the **Required reading for implementation** section with links to the project documentation files (and prior ADRs) that downstream phases — tasks planning and implementation — most need to read. Don't list new ADRs from this task here; those go in the metadata at the top.
- During iteration: revise the existing content rather than rewriting from scratch. Preserve sections the user has already endorsed.

### Step 5 — Write or update ADRs

- Number sequentially. Find the highest number in `.maister/docs/ADRs/INDEX.md` and increment. If the folder doesn't exist yet, create it and start at `0001`.
- Use [adr-template.md](adr-template.md).
- The Context section must be self-contained — describe the situation and forces directly, no links back to brainstorming or design.
- **Update `.maister/docs/ADRs/INDEX.md`** with an entry for each new ADR (number, title, one-line summary).
- During finalize: change `Status: proposed` to `Status: accepted` for ADRs the user has confirmed.

### Step 6 — Flag assumptions

Anything decided by inference rather than confirmed information goes in **Assumptions to verify**. Each entry states:

- **What** the assumption is
- **Why it matters** (what changes if it's wrong)
- **How to verify** (what to read, who to ask, what to test)

Be generous — better to over-flag than to bury a guess.

During finalize, this section should be empty (or removed entirely).

### Step 7 — Hand off

**If drafting**, show the user:
1. Path to the design doc
2. Paths to any new ADR files
3. Short summary of what's in **Assumptions to verify**

Then stop. The user reviews and pushes back. Iterate from Step 1 with the existing design as input.

**If finalizing**, show the user:
1. Path to the design doc, now `Status: final`
2. ADR status changes (which moved from `proposed` to `accepted`)
3. Confirmation that **Assumptions to verify** is empty
4. Confirmation that `.maister/docs/ADRs/INDEX.md` is up to date

## What goes in the design (and what doesn't)

| Belongs in design                                     | Belongs elsewhere                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Module/component boundaries, responsibilities         | Requirements (→ brainstorming)               |
| Data model changes, migrations                        | Acceptance criteria (→ brainstorming)        |
| API/method signatures, error types, event payloads    | Constraints (→ brainstorming)                |
| Sequence diagrams, state machines                     | Discrete implementable units (→ tasks)       |
| Concrete framework/library choices                    | PR-sized work items (→ tasks)                |
| Resolution of brainstorming's open questions          | Test scenarios (→ tasks, paired with impl)   |
| Per-integration-point list of concrete changes        | Full method bodies (→ implementation)        |
