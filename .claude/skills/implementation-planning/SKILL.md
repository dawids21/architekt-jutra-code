description: Create a detailed, PR-ready implementation plan for a single task by investigating the codebase and filling a structured template. Use whenever the user asks to plan, write, draft, or generate an implementation plan (or 'impl plan', 'task plan') based on an existing `design.md` in a `.maister/tasks/development/<date>-<name>/` directory. Triggers on phrasings like "create implementation plan for task T2 in .maister/tasks/development/2025-11-15-shopping-lists", "plan the implementation for…", "write an impl plan for T3", "draft the implementation plan based on design.md". Handles both single-task mode (no `tasks.md`; plan saved at `<task-dir>/implementation-plan.md`) and multi-task mode (`tasks.md` exists; plan saved at `<task-dir>/plans/T<N>-implementation-plan.md`).

# Implementation Planning

Produce a detailed, PR-ready implementation plan that an engineer (or another
agent) can execute top-to-bottom without further interpretation. This is the
terminal planning step in a brainstorming → design → tasks → implementation-plan
workflow. The design work has already been done; this skill translates it into
a concrete, file-level plan grounded in the real codebase.

## Inputs

The user provides a **task directory path** and, in multi-task mode, a **task ID**.

Examples of valid invocations:

- `create implementation plan for task T2 in .maister/tasks/development/2025-11-15-shopping-lists` — multi-task mode, plan T2
- `plan the implementation for .maister/tasks/development/2026-04-18-fix-auth-redirect` — single-task mode
- `write an impl plan for T1 in .maister/tasks/development/2026-03-02-presigned-urls` — multi-task mode, plan T1

If the user omits the task directory path, stop and ask for it before doing
anything else.

## Mode detection

Detect the mode by inspecting the task directory:

- **Multi-task mode** — `<task-dir>/tasks.md` exists. The user must have named a
  specific task (T1, T2, …). Plan is written to
  `<task-dir>/plans/T<N>-implementation-plan.md`.
- **Single-task mode** — no `tasks.md` in `<task-dir>`. The entire `design.md`
  is the basis for one plan. Plan is written to
  `<task-dir>/implementation-plan.md` (directly in the task directory, NOT in a
  `plans/` subfolder).

If the user named a task ID but no `tasks.md` exists, stop and flag the
inconsistency — either the `tasks.md` is missing, the wrong directory was
named, or the user meant single-task mode.

If `tasks.md` exists but the user didn't name a task ID, stop and list the
task IDs from `tasks.md` and ask which one to plan.

## Workflow

### 1. Confirm inputs and mode

- Verify `<task-dir>/design.md` exists. If it's missing, stop — there is
  nothing to plan from, and this skill refuses to guess a design.
- Determine mode (see above).
- In multi-task mode, find the named task inside `tasks.md`. If the task ID
  doesn't exist in `tasks.md`, stop and list the ones that do.

### 2. Gather context

Read in roughly this order, taking notes as you go — the notes feed directly
into the template sections.

**Always**
- `.maister/docs/INDEX.md`, if it exists. Scan it for docs/standards relevant to what
  this task touches (persistence, API conventions, logging, testing,
  security, etc.).
- `<task-dir>/design.md` in full. Pay special attention to:
  - Required reading for implementation
  - Module & component boundaries
  - Data model changes
  - Interface contracts
  - Integration changes
  - Resolved questions (so you don't re-decide them)
  - Assumptions to verify (which become risks if unresolved)
- ADRs listed in `design.md`'s metadata and any ADRs linked from it.

**Multi-task mode only**
- The specific task entry in `tasks.md` — read **Scope**, **Out of scope**,
  **Depends on**, **Design references**, **How to verify**, and **Risks /
  unknowns**. These constrain the plan's boundaries.
- The `Summary` and `Cross-task notes` sections of `tasks.md` — they surface
  shared prerequisites, sequencing constraints, and parallelism.
- If the task has `Depends on: T<N>`, check whether
  `<task-dir>/plans/T<N>-implementation-plan.md` already exists. If not,
  note it in the response after writing the plan; don't block.

**Project docs & standards**
- Any file referenced from `design.md` > "Required reading for implementation".
- Anything in `.maister/docs/INDEX.md` directly relevant to the task's scope.

### 3. Investigate the codebase

This is what makes the plan useful rather than a rephrased design. The
template demands concrete filepaths and patterns to mirror — those come
from reading the actual repo, not from the design document.

Investigate along these axes, to whatever depth the task requires:

- **Integration points** — for each file the design says will change, open
  it and read enough surrounding context to understand the shape of the
  change.
- **New components** — for each new unit the design introduces, locate 1–2
  existing siblings in the same package / folder / module whose patterns
  the new code should follow. Capture their naming, structure, and
  conventions so the plan can point to them as "code to mirror".
- **Data model changes** — read the existing migration / schema files to
  determine ordering constraints and the next identifier. Check whether
  existing models need modification and identify ripple effects.
- **Dependencies** — inspect the project's dependency manifest(s) to
  confirm what needs to be added and at which version, matching the
  project's existing version conventions.
- **Tests** — find the nearest existing test file to each new test.
  Mirror its setup, fixtures, and assertion style.
- **Configuration** — check how existing configuration is organised so
  new config keys or environment variables follow the project's naming
  and placement.

Keep a running list of filepaths as you go — these populate both
**Required reading > Code to mirror** and **File inventory**.

If the investigation surfaces something that contradicts `design.md` — a
pattern that's no longer current, a file that's moved, a convention that
has shifted — don't silently paper over it. Capture it under **Risks
surfaced during planning**.

### 4. Fill the template

Read [`implementation-plan-template.md`](implementation-plan-template.md) and fill every section. The
template is authoritative for structure — sections appear in the template's
order, with the template's exact heading levels.

Strip the angle-bracket guidance (`<like this>`) from the output — it's
instructional, not content.

See **Per-section guidance** below for the rules that matter most.

### 5. Write the file

- **Multi-task mode**: `<task-dir>/plans/T<N>-implementation-plan.md`. Create
  the `plans/` directory if it doesn't exist.
- **Single-task mode**: `<task-dir>/implementation-plan.md`.

If the target file already exists, do NOT silently overwrite. Stop, tell the
user, and ask whether to overwrite, create a `.v2` variant, or abort.

## Per-section guidance

### Title and metadata
- **Multi-task mode** title: `# T<N>: <Task name> — Implementation Plan`,
  where `<Task name>` matches the name used in `tasks.md`.
- **Single-task mode** title: `# <Feature name> — Implementation Plan`
  (omit the `T<N>:` prefix).
- **Date**: today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` — not the date on `design.md`.
- **Status**: always `draft` for the first write.

### Required reading
Three subsections: Docs & standards, Design & ADRs, Code to mirror. Pull
only entries relevant to *this task* — don't copy `design.md`'s full list
verbatim. Every entry needs a one-line "why" note.

If a subsection has no entries, write `_None._` under its heading — don't
delete the heading.

### File inventory
Complete list. This is the most common place for a plan to fail: people
list the obvious new files and forget the ripple effects. Think through:
- Compiler / type errors that cascade (add a required field to a shared
  type and every caller needs an update).
- Fixture / factory changes.
- Logging configuration, metric registration.
- Build and dependency manifest(s).
- Migration files, and any seed-data SQL.
- Existing test files that need to assert new behaviour.

Mark each as `**CREATE**`, `**MODIFY**`, or `**DELETE**` with a ~10-word
description.

### Step-by-step plan
Commit-sized steps. A good test: each step should leave the repo in a state
where a human would cleanly commit and push. Order steps so something
demonstrable goes green at each one:

1. Scaffolding / contracts → compiles
2. Unit logic → unit tests pass
3. Wiring / integration → integration tests pass
4. End-to-end → manual verify succeeds

Each step names:
- Files touched (filepaths, not vague descriptions).
- A concrete **Verify** command or check — a specific test invocation, a
  `curl` with the expected response, a query showing the new state.
  Spell out the command, not the intent.

Don't restate *why* — the design.md has that. Focus on *what* and *how*.

### Test plan
Case lists, not promises. `FooServiceTest — happy path, validation failure`
is not a case list — expand it:
- `creates entity when all required fields present`
- `returns 400 when email is malformed`
- `is idempotent when the same request is retried`

For levels that don't apply, write `_N/A — <one-line reason>_`. Don't
delete the heading.

### Verification checklist
Tailor per task. Drop items that don't apply (no migration? drop that
line). Always include at minimum:
- Lint / formatter passes.
- All tests pass.
- `tasks.md` > "How to verify" for this task succeeds (multi-task mode),
  or the design's user-visible outcome is demonstrably achieved (single-task mode).
- Design's Assumptions to verify are resolved or explicitly deferred.

### Risks surfaced during planning
Only things that came up **while writing this plan** — not a restatement
of `tasks.md` > "Risks / unknowns". Examples:
- The existing pattern the design assumes has been refactored since the
  design was written.
- Two integration points conflict and one will need to be rewritten.
- A migration can't be safely rolled back and needs a forward-only path.

If nothing new came up:
- Multi-task mode: `_No additional risks beyond those in tasks.md._`
- Single-task mode: `_No risks surfaced during planning._`

## Edge cases

- **`design.md` missing** — stop. The skill refuses to generate a plan
  without a design.
- **Task ID not in `tasks.md`** — stop and list the available IDs.
- **Target plan file already exists** — stop and ask before overwriting.
- **Unresolved `Assumptions to verify` in `design.md`** — proceed, but
  capture each unresolved assumption in Risks surfaced during planning
  and mention them in the reply.
- **Task has `Depends on: T<N>` but no `T<N>-implementation-plan.md`** —
  proceed, but mention in the reply so the user can plan the
  prerequisites or reorder.
- **Codebase investigation contradicts design.md** — capture in Risks
  surfaced during planning and flag in the reply; don't silently adjust
  the plan to match the codebase, since the design may still be right and
  the code may be what needs to change.
